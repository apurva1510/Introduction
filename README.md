Hello world!

I'm Apurva Patel, a recent graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), where I majored in Electrical Engineering. This GitHub repository is a collection of my projects, labs, and assignments from high school through university, showcasing my journey and growth in the field of electrical engineering (focused on embedded systems and software).

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a passion for firmware and embedded software design, scripting, and automation. My coursework and hands-on projects have equipped me with a strong foundation in power systems, electronics, digital image processing, machine learning, computer networks, embedded systems design, SoC design, and computer architecture.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see detailed documentation, source code, and insights into the various projects I've worked on. Each repository includes a README file with information about the project, its objectives, and the technologies used.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I hope you find my work interesting and inspiring. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy coding!
